Abstract: In this thesis, we explore the theoretical foundations of vortex states in particle physics and specifically investigate the Î²-decay of muons in Bessel vortex states. We explore the various non-trivial polarizations of these Bessel states and compare  them with the decay of free (plane-wave) muon using their spectral angular and angular distributions. We discover that the differences between free and vortex muon  decays, as well as between various polarisation states, present intriguing possibilities for brand-new investigations for experiments and research. We find that while  polarization strongly affects the spectral angular distribution for vortex muons, the  angular distribution is less sensitive to different polarization states. The results confirm the theoretical potential of vortex states in high-energy physics and suggest  new avenues for experimental exploration.
